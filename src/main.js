Alpine Adventure - Biathlon Infinite Skier
Completed on May 3, 2020

Technically Interesting - Implemented single mouse clicks for menu control
(was previously part of the game until playtesting). All music was created
by Ben Rowland using the Bosca Ceoil sound program (https://boscaceoil.net/).
Blizzard effect helps create a balancing loop by punishing faster players
with worse vision conditions and clearing up for slower players.
